# NYC Taxi Dataset Analysis

Every month New York City releases data about trips taken in NYC taxis. 

In the following tasks, we will should focus on yellow cab data from the months of March, June, and November in 2017. 

In this repository we will:

### ~~Data exploration and cleaning~~

* ~~Download and assess the data~~
* ~~Identify and document any issues with the data~~
* ~~Document how you resolved these issues~~

### Data Summary

Create a brief report that summarizes the core features of the data and calls out interesting trends, etc. The audience for this should be other data scientists who need to understand that dataset.

### Model Building

Assume we want to predict the tip.

In building the model, we consider the following requirements:

* The model should be built from the taxi dataset and could be supplemented with external datasets.
* Document how you assess your models performance.
* Discuss any limitations or caveats of the model which might be an issue in implementing it.
* Discuss how you might improve your model going forward.
* Discuss how you might turn this model in to an API the company can use.
